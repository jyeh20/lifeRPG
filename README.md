# LifeRPG: Gamify Life

LifeRPG is a way to live your life as if you were in an RPG game. At the beginning of each day, you will receive a set of new **tasks** that you may complete. You will receive a reward in the form of points for completing each task. If you have completed all the tasks for the day, you may also claim a daily reward. You may also accomplish **goals** within LifeRPG which may offer larger rewards.

LifeRPG revolves around tasks and goals that you may customize to fit your life.
